                                <p>Customer relationship management (CRM) is an approach to manage a company's interaction with current and potential customers. It uses data analysis about customers' history with a company to improve business relationships with customers, specifically focusing on customer retention and ultimately driving sales growth.<br>
                                    One important aspect of the CRM approach is the systems of CRM that compile data from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website, telephone, email, live chat, marketing materials and more recently, social media.[2] Through the CRM approach and the systems used to facilitate it, businesses learn more about their target audiences and how to best cater to their needs.Customer relationship management (CRM) is the combination of practices, strategies and technologies that companies use to manage and analyze customer interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle, with the goal of improving customer service relationships and assisting in customer retention and driving sales growth.</p>
                                <p>Types of CRM technology:</p>
                                <p>On-premises CRM: This system puts the onus of administration, control, security and maintenance of the database and information on the company using the CRM software. With this approach, the company purchases licenses upfront instead of buying yearly subscriptions from a cloud CRM provider.</p>
                                <p>Cloud-based CRM: With cloud-based CRM, also known as SaaS (software as a service) or on-demand CRM, data is stored on an external, remote network that employees can access anytime, anywhere there is an internet connection, sometimes with a third-party service provider overseeing installation and maintenance. The cloud's quick, relatively easy deployment capabilities appeal to companies with limited technological expertise or resources.
                                </p>
                                <p>Benefit of CRM: Enhanced ability to target profitable customers. Integrated assistance across channels Enhanced sales force efficiency and effectiveness Improved pricing Customized products and services Improved customer service efficiency and effectiveness Individualized marketing messages also called campaigns Connect customers and all channels on a single platform.

                <h3>Do you need CRM</h3>
                <p>
                    Even though the benefits that CRM brings to the sales teams may not be immediately recognizable, they are still game-changing if implemented right. And since those are the sales people that need CRM the most, in this blog post I will bring out the key
                    reasons why CRM can help them achieve their sales goals faster and improve results. So, why do sales people need CRM? Without fear of oversimplifying, the biggest challenges that sales people face are
                    <ol>
                        <li>how to qualify and follow up on leads and </li>
                        <li>how to prioritize sales activities. However, CRM is a tool that not only solves those key problems. In fact, it is able to handle other, no less pressing issues. Watch the video below or scroll down to read why sales people
                            need CRM. </li>
                        <li>a safe storage space CRM helps sales people to safely and centrally store their contacts, sales opportunities, activities and scheduled plans in one place, and have uninterrupted access to the database
                            from multiple locations. Rest assured that your data wonâ€™t just get lost.</li>
                        <li>Plan and time-manage like a pro CRM helps sales people to optimize their daily schedules and prioritize tasks to make sure customers are not ignored and the key prospects are contacted on time. In fact, CRM allows sales
                            people to spend more time with customers, which leads to more deals closed and a stronger customer base. </li>
                        <li>Activity reports? â€“ No brainer! CRM helps sales people to easily prepare their weekly or monthly reports for management. The process is automated and transparent, and takes just a few clicks to inform others about what
                            sales are currently in progress. </li>
                        <li>Stop surfing, start targeting CRM helps sales people to segment data and identify valuable opportunities via criteria based selections. This prevents you from hours of cutting and pasting from various documents, or surfing
                            in the disorganized lists of data. </li>
                        <li>Stay up-to-date on whatâ€™s happening CRM offers shared calendars, document templates and e-mail integration, uniting all team members and keeping everyone up-to-date. Sharing selling patterns and processes allows sales people
                            to see what works best. CRM also increases communication between the sales force and sales management. </li>
                        <li>Show up in time for the new sale By tracking all communication with the customers, CRM helps sales people to know exactly when customers need to be contacted; for example, for product replacement, contract renewal, or for
                            an upsell to a new product or service. This all increases your chances of closing a sale. </li>
                        <li>Rationalize your sales moves CRM helps streamline the entire sales cycle, which results in closing deals in your sales pipeline and helping everyone in the team to reach targets faster. Since order processing and preparing
                            quotes is automated in CRM, sales teams are able to reduce production costs and increase sales revenue. </li>
                        <li>Know what your customers really want Since all the customer-related data is stored in CRM, it helps sales people to analyze the needs of customers and even anticipate their problems â€“ all at the right time. All this increases
                            customer satisfaction and ensures loyalty, as well as higher profit margins. </li>
                        <li>Cut down on admin tasks CRM releases the sales teams from the majority of admin tasks by reducing and even removing some of the repetitive actions that take a lot of time, but yield little profitability. CRM stores product
                            and price details, triggers reminders for activities, and takes sales people through the sales pipeline step by step. </li>
                        <li>Save money Even though CRM systems are not cheap, they actually help you save your money! With
                            sales people, it is the reduction of errors (for example, in orders or quotes) that CRM can help with. Effort and cost related to correcting those errors may be much higher. Finally, it also boils down to such trivial
                            things as saving money on those cluttering and often vanishing Post-it notes, since every new information can be safely stored in the system.</li>
