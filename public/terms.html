                    You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at:
                    https://esycrm.com/terms
                </p>
                <p>
                    Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While service
                    provider prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that the
                    service provider cannot be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may
                    be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basic Terms
                </p>

                    Access to the Service is permitted only to those that fully agree with the terms and conditions of
                    this Terms of Service agreement.<br>
                    You agree that this Terms of Service Agreement and the relationship between the parties shall be
                    exclusively governed by the laws of Estonia without regard to conflict of law principles, or

                    You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. The service provider
                    cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security
                    obligation.
                    The Client undertakes to maintain full confidentiality over the Client’s passwords related to the

                    You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the

                    the Service in any way.<br>

                    provided will be charged automatically and immediately for the new prorated fee.<br>
                    Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. The
                    service provider does not accept any liability for such loss.<br>

                <p>
                    You are solely responsible for properly cancelling your account. An email or phone request to cancel

                    can not be recovered once your account is cancelled.<br>
                    If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take
                    effect immediately and you will not be charged again.<br>
                    The service provider, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and
                    refuse any and all current or future use of the Service for any reason at any time. Such termination
                    of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your
                    Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. The service provider
                    reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.<br>

                    change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.<br>

                    time without prior notice to the Client due to the fact that the Service Provider is constantly
